# Free Social Benefit Coins 
# A Blockchain, Crypto, Sharable Prosperity, Giftivism based Airdrop idea. by Gregory Kennedy

Here is my very simple argument. Kindness is a business model that can scale within set parameters.

If Dogecoin, a cryptocurrency that began as a joke can have a valuation of $1 Billion+ with almost no development work being done over the past few years, it is my hypothesis that a cryptocurrency given away for *free to persons, organizations, and even companies who can prove that they are and have been committed to building a more just, more diverse and more inclusive society and world, has the possibility to transform the greed in the Blockchain Crypto space and be a real world example of how to utilize Blockchain for social benefit.

“Kindness scales better than competitiveness, frustration, pettiness, regret, revenge, merit (whatever that means) or apathy. Kindness ratchets up. It leads to more kindness. It can create trust and openness and truth and enthusiasm and patience and possibility. Kindness, in one word, is a business model, an approach to strangers and a platform for growth. It might take more effort than you were hoping it would, but it’s worth it.” — Seth Godin

My BHAG — Big Hairy Audacious Goal.

To launch a NO-ICO Airdrop giving away *free Social Benefit Coins (SBC). My BHAG is based on what I believe was the original intent of Satoshi Nakamoto, combined with my own personal passion for and experience with Blockchain, seven generation principles, sharable prosperity, and gift-tivism.
